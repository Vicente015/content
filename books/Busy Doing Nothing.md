title: Busy Doing Nothing
subtitle: Busy Doing Nothing is the revised and improved version of the North Pacific Logbook chronicling our sailing voyage from Japan to Canada. The passage took 51 days, and it was the hardest thing we've ever done. We decided to keep a physical logbook of daily happenings onboard. Upon our arrival, we transcribed the handwritten pages, so we could publish them into a book.
